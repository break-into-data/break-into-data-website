<h2 class="centered-header">Why Choose This Workshop?</h2>

Unlike regular Kaggle projects on Jupyter notebooks that don't prepare you for professional data science standards or collaborative work, our workshop offers:

1. Building recommender system with deep dive into the architecture.
2. Hands-on experience building production-ready applications.
3. Using Ticket Management System.
4. Git version control system (VCS) proficiency.
5. Exposure to tech stacks used in ML startups and tech companies.
6. Access to our AI-powered chatbot, trained on project materials and live sessions.
7. Constructive feedback to improve your portfolio.

Beyond technical skills, the workshop emphasizes project management, collaboration, and problem-solving, equipping you with valuable industry experience.

<br><br>
**Preliminary Requirements:**

1. Basic Python knowledge with 6-12 months of coding experience.
2. Familiar with basic Machine Learning concepts (e.g., supervised learning, regression, classification).

Don't do it alone - be part of a small cohort of other participants buillding real application systems.
